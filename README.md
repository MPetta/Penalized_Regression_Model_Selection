# Penalized_Regression_Model_Selection
Penalized regression methods are assessed here to determine best fit for data on atmospheric conditions. Initial data preprocessing was conducted to deal with missing values and colinearity. Alternative method were then considered. Penalized regression methods of Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and LASSO were assessed and cross validated to tune lamda values. A bootstrap comparison to confirm reduction in variability of estimates of standard deviations follows. A final cross validated assessment of the assessment process concludes the script.
